## Introduction
Families outfitted with a fleet of smartphones have a lot of options for checking in that don't require exercising those texting thumbs or distracting a driver with a call just to find out exactly when he or she is coming home for dinner.
Everyone in this world needed to know where is the family member and the most common way is “Make A Call To Each One “Is this a feasible way of doing ?  
What if someone is busy, or driving a vehicle, or he/she not able to take that call right now, so in that case what will you do drop a message (WhatsAPP) is this what you thinking about then again think about it. You call a person he/she not taking your call then you drop a message to theme again “NO REPLY “but you desperately want to know his/her current location and you again and again call him or message but many times we are in some situation in which we are not able to reply that call/message and we also think that the person should know where am i. 
The Google maps API are used to show all the devices on that are registered in web application which is running on your home. The smartphone contains android app which sends data at user define period to the web application. This tracking system especially design for parents to monitor their children’s on the move. Consider a situation where a child lost a way to home or he or she meet with an accident in that case child use there tracker app to send alert notification to parents and the web application display it. The web application is design to handle various types of alert that broadcast from android app.
We investigate the following fundamental question - how fast can we track a family member? And the answer that we got is by calling him but this is not a feasible or reliable solution. Many times it’s happen that you’re driving and you get the call but you’re in condition that you can’t answer that call. Now
